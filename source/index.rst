   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to bme590hrm's documentation!
=====================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

This is the documentation site to the **Heart Rate Monitor**
assignment created by *Angelina Liu* (cl428).



Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`modindex`

   This is the index page to all modules/functions.
* :ref:`genindex`

   This is the index to all modules and functions. Since all functions
   are in separate modules, it may seem redundant. But this can be used to find function names,
   which is sometimes separate from the file name.
* :ref:`search`

   Use the search function to search for all content pages.
